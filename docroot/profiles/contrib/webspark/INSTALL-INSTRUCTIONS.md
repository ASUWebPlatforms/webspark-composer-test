# Instructions

These instructions will work for new installs on a Vanilla Drupal site as well as for updating an existing Webspark site. We are consolidating the Webspark profile into a single package to simplify maintenance and updates going forward. This means that some small adjustments may be necessary to bring your codebase into compliance with these changes.

## Delete the existing webspark profile (if it exists)

Delete the existing webspark profile folder located at `docroot/profiles/webspark`. You can do this with `rm -rf docroot/profiles/webspark` from your terminal.

## Delete the existing webspark modules and theme (if they exist)

Delete the existing webspark modules and theme folders:

- `rm -rf docroot/modules/webspark`
- `rm -rf docroot/themes/webspark`

## Temporarily remove root required dependencies

- In order to properly install the consolidated webspark profile, you will need to TEMPORARILY remove all of the required packages from your root `composer.json` file.
- We recommend copying the entire `require` section from your root `composer.json` file and pasting it into a temporary text file for safekeeping. You will need to reference this later when moving non-Webspark packages to the `custom-dependencies` folder.
- After you have removed the `require` section from your root `composer.json` file, save the file.

## Delete the composer.lock file

To avoid dependency clashes, remove the root-level composer.lock file.

## Temporarily remove patches

- The `composer.patches.json` file at the root of your repository needs to be adjusted. Compare it with the version located in `docroot/profiles/contrib/webspark/webspark-dependencies-source/patches.webspark.json` and remove any of the items that exist in that file from the root `composer.patches.json` file.
- Then, take what is remaining, copy it, and paste it into a temporary text file.
- Your root `composer.patches.json` file should basically be empty now, leaving only the following content:

```json
{
  "patches": {}
}
```

## Get the required composer packages

Install the necessary composer packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ddev composer require asuwebplatforms/webspark:^2.16.4 wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin:^2.1.0
```

## Add custom-dependencies directory (if it doesn't exist)

- If your repository does not already have a `custom-dependencies` directory at the root level, you will need to create it. You can do so by copying the `custom-dependencies-source` directory from this profile and pasting it into the root of your repository. Then, rename the copied directory from `custom-dependencies-source` to `custom-dependencies`.
- If you already have a `custom-dependencies` directory, you should ensure that its contents include everything that is in the `custom-dependencies-source` directory, making adjustments as necessary.
  - If you have a `scripts` directory in your existing `custom-dependencies` folder, please delete it.
  - If you have a `patches` directory in your existing `custom-dependencies` folder, you can keep it, if it has local patch files that you need for your site.

For more information about the `custom-dependencies` folder and its purpose, please refer to the README file located within that directory.

## Add webspark-dependencies directory

- If your repository contains an `upstream-configuration` directory at the root level, you will need to delete it. This directory is no longer needed with the newly consolidated webspark profile (as of Webspark 2.16.4).
- Copy the `webspark-dependencies-source` directory from this profile and paste it into the root of your repository.
- Rename the copied directory from `webspark-dependencies-source` to `webspark-dependencies`.
- Edit the namespace declarations in the two PHP files within the `scripts` directory to be `WebsparkCustomScripts` instead of `SampleWebsparkCustomScripts` and save them.

For more information about the `webspark-dependencies` folder and its purpose, please refer to the README file located within that directory.

## Re-add patches

Compare what you saved into a temporary text file with what exists in `custom-dependencies/patches.custom.json`, making sure that the `custom-dependencies/patches.custom.json` file contains all of the patches unique to your site.

From this point on, the root `composer.patches.json` file will be dynamically populated via a composer script that combines the patches in your custom-dependencies `patches.custom.json` file and the webspark profile's `patches.webspark.json` file when you run `composer update` or `composer install`.

## Adjust your composer.json

You will need to adjust your root `composer.json` file to ONLY have three items in its `require` section, as seen below. To accomplish this, you will need to move some items to the new `custom-dependencies` folder as described in the next section.

```json
    "require": {
        "asu/custom-dependencies": "*",
        "asuwebplatforms/webspark": "^2.16.4",
        "wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin": "^2.1.0",
    },
```

## Move non-Webspark composer packages to the custom-dependencies composer.json file

- Compare the `require` items you pasted into a temporary text file from the root composer.json file with composer.json file located in `docroot/profiles/contrib/webspark/composer.json` and remove any items in your temporary file that duplicate what is in the profile.
- Any remaining items, other than the three indicated above in the `require` section, will need to be moved into the appropriate `composer.json` file in the `custom-dependencies` folder.

## Update your root composer.json's extra, autoload, scripts, repositories and require-dev sections

For the Webspark profile to work properly, you will need to ensure that the following sections in your root `composer.json` file include the following items, at a minimum:

```json
     "extra": {
        "merge-plugin": {
            "require": [
                "docroot/modules/contrib/webform/composer.libraries.json"

## Update composer

Run `ddev composer update` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and updated.

## Verify the update

During the update process, pay close attention to the output in your terminal. You should see something like the following (truncated for brevity):

Open the `composer.patches.json` file at the root of your project and verify that it has been populated with the patches from both the webspark profile and your custom-dependencies.

If you encountered no issues or errors during the update process, you have successfully updated your project to use the consolidated webspark profile!
